                <div id="brand_desc">Eva Varro seeks to bridge the gap between European haute couture and American mainstream fashion by creating elegant but comfortable plus-size fashions. Eva worked for leading fashion design companies in both Hungary and Italy before creating her eponymous line in 2002 here in the United States. Made with superior fabric as well as strong technique, her fashions continue to be made in Los Angeles. Her use of color and pattern are the cherry on top! Bombshell has featured the line since late 2013.</div>

                <div id="brand_desc">From the illustrious house of MaxMara comes Persona by Marina Rinaldi, dedicated to women who don’t want to give up quality clothes and a contemporary, feminine style simply because they wear plus-sizes (sounds like our girl!). Persona by Marina Rinaldi has a dynamic and strong personality paired with classic sensibility. Not only we will debut this line at Bombshell in fall of 2015, we will also have part of the couture collection they designed specifically for Berlin Curvy Plus fashion week!</div>

                <div id="brand_desc">We are over the moon to have Tadashi Shoji’s plus-size dresses at Bombshell! Truly designer works of art, these dresses are perfect for occasions: galas, weddings, and any other time you want to knock it out of the park (there’s a reason Academy Award-winning Octavia Spencer almost exclusively wears Tadashi Shoji on the red carpet). Mr. Shoji believes that “every woman, regardless of size and shape, deserves to feel confident, comfortable and gorgeous.” We couldn’t have said it better ourselves!</div>
